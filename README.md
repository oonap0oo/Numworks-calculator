## simpsonrule.py

![simpson_screenshot.png](simpson_screenshot.png)

The Numworks calculator can calculate definite integrals without coding using the Calculation or Grapher apps.

However this script explores the "1/3 Simpson rule" for definite integrals. It defines the function:

    simpson(fun,a,b,n)

* fun is a python function of one variable to apply integration on
* a, b is the integration interval
* n is the number of points to be used

This code can run on CPython as well. Tested on the calculator using software version 23.2.6.


## mass_spring_damper_runge.py

![mass-spring-damper_screenshot.png](mass-spring-damper_screenshot.png)
![mass_spring_damper_runge_screenshot.png](mass_spring_damper_runge_screenshot.png)


These scripts plot a solution for the dampened mass-spring system. The first uses a simple Euler method. The second a Runge-Kutta method

The second degree ODE for the mass-spring-damper system has to be modified into two first order ODEs.

    d²x/dt²+ 2*ζ*ωn*dx/dt + ωn²*x = 0
    v = dx/dt

    => dv/dt + 2*ζ*ωn*v + ωn²*x = 0

    => dv/dt = -2*ζ*ωn*v - ωn²*x
       dx/dt = v

     ωn = sqrt(k/m)
     ζ = c/(2*m*ωn)

* Undamped systems ζ = 0
* Underdamped systems ζ < 1
* Critically damped systems ζ = 1
* Overdamped systems ζ > 1

These scripts use matplotlib for plotting.

##  pendulum_runge4.py

![pendulum_screenshot.png](pendulum_screenshot.png)

Damped, driven pendulum

This script calculates a solution to the ODE for a driven pendulum with damping. 

    I*d(dθ/dt)/dt + m*g*l*sin(θ) + b*dθ/dt = a*cos(Ω*t)

This second order non linear ODE has been to be modified to a system of two first order ODEs. 

    dω/dt = 1/I*( -g*m/l*sin(θ) - b*ω + a*cos(Ω*t) )
    dθ/dt = ω

The script uses a 4th order Runge-Kutta method  to calculate a solution of this system.

This solution is then plotted.

The libraries math, numpy and matplotlib are used.

## euler_spiral.py

![euler_spiral_screenshot.png](euler_spiral_screenshot.png)

This script draws an "Euler's Spiral" also known as "Cornu Spiral".

Two Fresnel integrals have to be calculated, this code uses a Maclaurin series approximation.

Also the Numworks math module does not seem to have a factorial function, so this had to be coded as well.

It also uses a function coded here in Python to draw a line between any two x,y points.

It is possible to draw this spiral using the Numworks calculator's graphing app as well.

## Truchet Tiles using Python & Turtle

![truchet_numworks_screenshot.png](truchet_numworks_screenshot.png)

This script is a strong simplification of a version made for CPython to run on a PC
see:
[GitHub truchet_tiles2.py](https://github.com/oonap0oo/Python-and-Turtle?tab=readme-ov-file#truchet_tiles2py)

This numworks version also uses the Turtle library, unlike the PC version it does not have the capability to fill a shape.

This script shows a series of patterns of Truchet Tiles.

The tiles are drawn using the Turtle libary. All patters are made from 4 different tiles.

The patterns are defined as rows and columns of tile numbers, for this nested tuples are used:

    pattern_X = (
        (2,4,3,4,4,2),
        (2,1,2,2,4,4),
        (3,4,4,2,2,4),
        (2,2,4,4,2,1),
        (4,2,2,4,3,4),
        (4,4,2,1,2,2)
        )

## random_walk.py

![random_walk_screenshot.png](random_walk_screenshot.png)

## rms.py

![rms_screenshot1.png](rms_screenshot1.png)

This script calculates the average and root mean square values of some common waveforms. 

After selection of a waveform the avg and rms are shown as function of amplitude.

The user can enter amplitude and in case of a pulse the duty-cycle. The numerical values for avg and rms are then calculated.

The information about the waveforms is stored in a nested tuple.

Only the math library is used. The code also runs on a PC using CPython.

## rc.py

![rc_screenshot.png](rc_screenshot.png)
![rc_screenshot2.png](rc_screenshot2.png)

This script defines a number of functions to calculate the impedance of resistor - capacitor combinations

* zcap(c,f) impedance of capacitance c at frequency f, returns a complex number for impedance
* zseries(r,c,f) impedance of series resistance r and capacitance c at frequency f, returns a complex number for impedance
* zparall(r,c,f) impedance of parallel resistance r and capacitance c at frequency f, returns a complex number for impedance
* z_all() to keep things interactive, this function asks for input values and returns impedance of bith series and parallel combinations

Exponential notation can be used to input values for example

    1e-6

for a capacitance value means 

    0.000001 Farad or
    1 micro Farad

The code also runs on CPython on a PC 


## heron.py

![heron_screenshot.png](heron_screenshot.png)

## colorcode.py
![colorcode_screenshot1.png](colorcode_screenshot1.png)
![colorcode_screenshot4.png](colorcode_screenshot4.png)

By entering the color-bands of a resistor this scripts gives the value and tolerance. Works with 4 band or 5 band resistors. The script also runs in CPython on a PC. Tested on the calculator using software version 23.2.6.

## quirk.py

![quirk_screenshot_calc.png](quirk_screenshot_calc.png)

This script demonstrates a quirk with the numpy implementation in Numworks. 
When tested with software version 23.2.6. 
When multiplying a int or float with a numpy array an error occurs if the int or float comes first. 
For example as in float * array. When the array comes first as in array * float the operation works fine. 
Also converting the int or float to a one element array eliminates the error.

## stopwatch.py

![stopwatch_screenshot.png](stopwatch_screenshot.png)

This implements a simple stopwatch. It uses the time module for the monotonic() function. It also uses kandinsky to put text on the screen at a fixed position and ion to detect key presses. Tested on the calculator using software version 23.2.6.

## stopwatch7segments.py

![stopwatch7segments_screenshot.png](stopwatch7segments_screenshot.png)

Stopwatch which displays time in 7 segment characters similar to vintage equipment. 

The 7 segment characters are drawn using the function

    kandinsky.fill_rect() 

A Python dictionary contains the information that decides which segments should be visible when displaying a certain character. The on/off state is stated as boolean literals True or False.

The position and orientation of the 7 segments is kept in a nested tuple.

The script also uses the time and ion libraries.

Tested on the calculator using software version 23.2.6.

## ellipse.py

![ellipse_screenshot1.png](ellipse_screenshot1.png)
![ellipse_screenshot2.png](ellipse_screenshot2.png)

## ohm.py

![ohm_screenshot.png](ohm_screenshot.png)

This ‘Ohms law helper’ allows you to type the two known variables with the unit added for example 5V or 0.1A or 10000ohm and the script automatically calculates the third variable which was unknown. Uses no imported libraries, also runs in CPython on a PC. Tested on the calculator using software version 23.2.6.
